			<h3>How</h3>
			<p>Imagine a beautiful, smooth lake. Now picture a stone skipping across that lake, causing the water to ripple. Your mind is that lake. Your thoughts are the stones that agitate the surface. When you learn to meditate, you learn to keep your mind clear and the lake smooth, even when thoughts, emotions, and circumstances threaten to interfere. </p>


			<p>Start a meditation session by sitting still, breathing deeply, and focusing the mind. Thoughts will arise. You are hungry, thirsty, tired, annoyed. So be it. Your mind wanders. Allow it. The idea isn't to banish all thoughts but just to notice them. See those thoughts as separate from yourself. "Witness" them with a neutral, nonjudgemental mindset. Over time, your focus will improve. You'll let go more easily. You'll acquire meditation skills that can be applied in any setting. </p>

			<h4>Meditation Tips</h4>

			<ul>
				<li>Find a quiet spot where you feel peaceful and won't be disturbed.</li>
				<li>The traditional time to meditate is morning, because it's a quiet time of renewal.</li>
				<li>Start out meditating for five minutes each day for a week, and increase the time each week by five minutes.</li>
				<li>Set up a timer so you don't keep checking the clock.</li>
				<li>When you feel drowsy or distracted, continue bringing your awareness back to your breath.</li>
			</ul>

			<div class="about">
				<p>Meditation and yoga poses are intrinsically tied together. Both are key steps on the yogi's path to enlightenment. Historically, yoga's physical poses were done to prepare the body for meditation, relaxing, and opening the body to enable the yogi to sit comfortably for long periods of time without discomfort. Today, meditation is a wonderful way to deal with the stresses of modern life by taking the time to stop and become one with the present moment.</p>

				<h4>Meditation Positions</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Cross-legged: Sit in a cross-legged position and rock your pelvis back and forth a few times to find a position where your lower back has a slight natural, inward curve. If your back is rounded, sit on a pillow, cushion, or folded-up towel.</li>
					<li>Legs outstretched: Sit on the floor with your legs stretched out in front of you. If your lower back is rounded in this position and not perfectly upright, sit on a pillow, cushion, or folded-up towel.</li>
					<li>Seated in a chair: Bring the soles of your feet to the floor. Imagine a string is attached to the top of your head and someone is gently pulling on it, lengthening the back of your neck and spine.</li>
					<li>Kneeling: Sit on the tops of your feet, or put a pillow underneath your buttocks.</li>
				</ul>
