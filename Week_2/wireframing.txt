Wireframing is an effective tool that allows for teams of web developers to collaborate on and alter the layout of a website. I also think wireframing is important because having the foundation of a website first is key to having a website with a good flow that allows users to have a positive experience. It is essential to ask what the problems are of previous users, so they can be addressed in the layout and flow of the webpage. Creating a rough draft in the early stages is crucial for getting feedback early on and being able to refine and alter changes for the better.
